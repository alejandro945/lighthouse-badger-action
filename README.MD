# LightHouse Badger GitHub Action üèÜ

[![Lighthouse Badger](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lighthouse-Badger-green.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/lighthouse-badger)

## Overview

**LightHouse Badger** is a GitHub Action that automates the process of generating Lighthouse report badges in SVG format for each Lighthouse category (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, PWA). This action can then upload the generated badges to either an AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage for easy access and sharing.

## Key Features

- **Automated Badge Generation**: Generates SVG badges from Lighthouse reports for the main Lighthouse categories.
- **Flexible Upload Destination**: Supports uploading badges to either AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into your GitHub CI/CD pipeline to visualize and track performance improvements over time.

## Usage

### Example 1: Uploading Badges to AWS S3

```yaml
name: Generate and Upload Lighthouse Badges to S3
on: [push]

jobs:
  lighthouse-badger:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Lighthouse Badger
        uses: alejandro945/lighthouse-badger@v1
        with:
          s3-bucket-name: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
          s3-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          s3-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          s3-region: 'us-west-2'
          s3-prefix: 'lighthouse-badges'
          upload-destination: 's3'
          report-path: '.lighthouseci'
          result-categories: 'performance,accessibility,best-practices,seo,pwa'
      
      - name: Output S3 URL
        run: echo "Badges uploaded to: ${{ steps.lighthouse-badger.outputs.s3-url }}"
```

### Example 2: Uploading Badges to Azure Blob Storage

```yaml
name: Generate and Upload Lighthouse Badges to Azure
on: [push]

jobs:
  lighthouse-badger:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Lighthouse Badger
        uses: alejandro945/lighthouse-badger@v1
        with:
          azure-container-name: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME }}
          azure-storage-account-name: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}
          azure-storage-account-key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STORAGE_KEY }}
          upload-destination: 'azure'
          report-path: '.lighthouseci'
          result-categories: 'accessibility,best-practices,seo,pwa'

      - name: Output Azure Blob URL
        run: echo "Badges uploaded to: ${{ steps.lighthouse-badger.outputs.azure-blob-url }}"
```

## Prerequisites

- **AWS S3**: If using S3 for uploads, ensure you have your S3 bucket, access key, and secret key available. You can securely store these as GitHub secrets.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For Azure uploads, you'll need to set up your Azure Storage account and container, with the corresponding access credentials stored as GitHub secrets.

## Setting up Secrets in GitHub

To securely pass your credentials to the action, you must add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **AWS S3**: Add `AWS_S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
2. **Azure Blob Storage**: Add `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, and `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`.
